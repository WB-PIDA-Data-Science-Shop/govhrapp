 This dashboard provides a standard set of indicators and visualizations on HRMIS analytics, building on the World Bank's [Public Sector and Employment Assessment Framework](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/324801640074379484/pdf/Public-Sector-Employment-and-Compensation-An-Assessment-Framework.pdf). The objective of this assessment is to conduct public sector employment and compensation assessments that can help develop evidence-based reforms.

The assessment framework consists of two parts. The first part assesses both the institutional and behavioral aspects of employment and compensation practices. It comprises six dimensions:

1. Wage bill planning.
2. Wage bill controls.
3. Employment levels and distribution of the public sector workforce.
4. Wage competitiveness of the public sector.
5. Wage equity.
6. Wage incentives.

The second part assesses the impact of these employment and compensation practices on:

1. Fiscal sustainability.
2. Public sector productivity.
3. Labor allocation between the public and private sectors.
