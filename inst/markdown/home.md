**This is the Analytics Suite.**

 The dashboard provides a standard set of indicators and visualizations on personnel analytics, building on the World Bank's [Public Sector and Employment Assessment Framework](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/324801640074379484/pdf/Public-Sector-Employment-and-Compensation-An-Assessment-Framework.pdf). The objective of this assessment is to produce analytical insights on the wagebill and workforce to inform policy decisions on personnel management.

The assessment framework consists of two parts:

**💵 Wage Bill Analysis**
- Time trends in total compensation expenditures
- Cross-sectional comparison across establishments, occupations, and demographics
- Year-over-year growth rate analysis
- Equity and wage dispersion assessment

**🚶 Workforce Analysis**
- Time trends in public sector headcount
- Cross-sectional comparison of workforce size across groups
- Year-over-year growth rate and hiring/attrition patterns
- Workforce composition by contract type, occupation, and demographics
