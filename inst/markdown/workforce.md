This section assesses whether a public sector is over- or under-staffed by comparing public employment to total, paid, and formal-sector employment.  Globally, the public sector accounts on average for about 16% of total employment, 30% of wage employment and 37% of formal-sector wage employment — though there is wide cross-country variation, with public-sector shares ranging from under 2% to over 40%. The analysis of employment distribution examines examine whether the right number of staff are employed in the right functions, locations, and sectors — to ensure efficiency and avoid distortions.

Guidance questions for the assessment:

1. Is the public sector over- or understaffed in aggregate and what have been the employment trends over time?
2. Is the public sector over- or understaffed for particular skills and occupations, both in aggregate and in specific
organizational and territorial jurisdictions?
3. Are there a large proportion of public sector workers with low educational qualifications or in low-skilled jobs?
4. Is the public sector a gender-equal employer?
a. What are the proportion of women in aggregate?
b. Is there horizontal and vertical segregation in employment?
5. Is there a dual labor regime with a large segment of contract workers, and what are its implications for public
sector employment?
