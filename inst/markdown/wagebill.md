The wage bill represents a substantial and rigid share of government expenditures. Managing it well, today and prospectively in the future, requires evidence-based insights. This section presents data-driven indicators that inform the governance of the wage bill. 

Guidance questions:

1. What are the main stylized facts about the wage bill: its actual size, evolution, and decomposition into employment and wages?
2. Is wage bill management anchored in comprehensive, accurate, and timely data? 
3. Is wage bill planning integrated in a broader medium-term fiscal framework? Are forward budget estimates derived from models of future wage bill commitments?
4. How does the institutional regime for salary setting impact wage bill planning? Are there particular challenges for subnational wage bill planning due to mismatches in staffing decisions and funding between central and subnational governments?
