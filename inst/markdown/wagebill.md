The wage bill represents a large and less flexible component of government expenditures with significant future liabilities. Globally, and noting the difficulties with cross-country comparisons, the wage bill represents approximately 30 percent of government expenditures, with significant variation around this average. 

This section presents some indicators that can help governments better understand and manage their wage bill.

Guidance questions for the assessment:

1. What are the main stylized facts about the wage bill: its actual size, evolution, and decomposition into employment and wages?
2. Is wage bill management anchored in comprehensive, accurate, and timely data? 
3. Is wage bill planning integrated in a broader medium-term fiscal framework? Are forward budget estimates derived from models of future wage bill commitments?
4. How does the institutional regime for salary setting impact wage bill planning? Are there particular challenges for subnational wage bill planning due to mismatches in staffing decisions and funding between central and subnational governments?
5. Are staffing increases informed by needs and medium-term strategic planning, or primarily by short-term political considerations?
6. Is there any public debate or public disclosure around wage bill policies?
