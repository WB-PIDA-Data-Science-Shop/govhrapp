This section analyzes public sector wage bill trends over time, examining total compensation expenditures across different dimensions such as establishments, contract types, and personnel demographics. The analysis supports three wage measures: base salary, gross salary, and net salary.

The analysis provides insights into:

1. **Time trends**: Wage bill and growth patterns over time, with optional baseline indexing to compare relative changes.
2. **Total by group**: Compare wage bill spending across different groups (establishments, occupations, demographics) at the latest available period.
3. **Growth rate by group**: Examine year-over-year changes in wage bill by group to identify spending expansion or contraction patterns.
4. **Variation**: Assess wage distribution and dispersion across groups to identify potential inequities in compensation.

<!-- **Guidance questions:**

- How has the total public sector wage bill evolved over time?
- Which establishments or sectors account for the largest share of wage bill spending?
- Are there significant differences in compensation levels across contract types, occupations, or demographic groups?
- What are the recent wage bill growth trends across different segments of the public sector?
- How equitably are wages distributed within and across different groups? -->
