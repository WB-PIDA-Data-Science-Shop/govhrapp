\title{Create a Segment Plot with Jittered Points}
\usage{
plot_segment(.data, col, group)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the variables to plot.}

\item{col}{Character string specifying the name of the numeric column to plot
on the x-axis.}

\item{group}{Character string specifying the name of the grouping column for
the y-axis.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object displaying:
\itemize{
\item Grey horizontal segments showing the range (min to max) for each group
\item Jittered points showing the distribution of individual observations
\item Groups ordered by median value (highest to lowest, top to bottom)
}
}
\description{
Produces a ggplot2 visualization showing the range (min to max) and distribution
of values for a numeric variable across different groups. Groups are ordered by
their median values in descending order.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Computes min, max, and median for each group
\item Handles infinite values by converting them to NA
\item Orders groups by median in descending order
\item Uses hollow circles (shape = 1) for points with 70\% transparency
\item Applies minimal theme styling
}
}
\examples{
plot_segment(mtcars, col = "mpg", group = "cyl")

}
